<h1>FAQ and Help</h1>
This document is to aid in understanding what the dashboard is displaying and how best to use the controls provided.
</p>

<h2>What Data is This Using?</h2>
<p>
This dashboard uses data collected from Google analytics and Google Tag Manager. The dashboard updates daily,
grabbing data for the previous day. This means that the dashboard will always display data that is at least one
day old. This is done to ensure we do not provide an incomplete picture about a given day.
</p>

<h2>What Do These Plots Show?</h2>

<h2>What is Considered a Session</h2>
<p>
  A session is defined as a group of interactions one user takes without a given time frame of inactivity on our website. We set that time frame to 30 minutes. Meaning whatever a user does on our website (e.g. browses pages, downloads resources) before they leave or go inactive for 30 minutes or more equals one session.
</p>

<h2>What is Considered a Conversion?</h2>
<p>
  A conversion is an event which can only occurr on the final page of a users session. A conversion is an action
  which indicates a user completed a desired action during their session either dumping them into a funnel or
  providing them with information or a document that will help them further complete their desired action. The
  following actions are considered conversions: any click to a quick action link, contact link clicks, document
  downloads, and callout link clicks.
