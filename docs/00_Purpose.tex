\subsection*{Purpose of this Document}
The purpose of this document is to provide interested readers with a \textit{friendly} overview of the main tools used in the analysis of Formstack survey response data, particularly probability theory basics, Bayesian inference, and linear regression. A number of resources are already available in the bradford repository \href{https://github.com/massgov/bradford/blob/master/docs/suggested_reading.txt}{suggested reading list} and within the \href{http://mdo.digital.mass.gov/bayes.html}{MDO dashboard}, but this document will serve to integrate a number of those resources and apply our specific goals to the generalized ideas presented in those resources.
